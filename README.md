# Analyze marketing campaign data
Extract information pertaining to and analyze effectiveness of marketing campaigns

## Primary Objectives:

- Determine how many unique users see a marketing campaign each day
- Assess Conversation Rate for entire duration of marketing campaigns
- Analyze the 1-month Retention Rate
- Determine the most effective subscribing channel (among House-Ads, Email, Facebook, Instagram and Push) contributing to the highest conversion and retention rates.
- Understand the most preferred language, and for which customer segmentation
- Which age group are most promising to get the biggest bang for the buck
- Which days of the week are most suitable to send out an ad
- Are there any data discrepancies and what impact do they have

## Core Concepts
- Customer Segmentation / Cohort Analysis
- Conversion Rate
- Retention Rate
- Conversion Attribution - automation of common marketing analysis

## Data
- `100K samples` assessed
- `7309 unique users`
- `31 days of marketing campaigns`
- The data used for this notebook is prepared by DataCamp. I have leveraged this to build on and draw insightful insights

## Key Outcomes
- On an average, `~300 users see a marketing campaign each day`
- `Conversation Rate` for entire duration of marketing campaigns = `13.09%`
- `1-month Retention Rate = 66.8%`
- `House-Ads was the most effective subscribing channel` (among Email, Facebook, Instagram and Push) contributing to the highest conversion and retention rates.
- `English was the most preferred language`, especially in the subscriber age group of 19-24 years
- Prospects in `age group 24-30 years converted the most`
- `Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday` were the days of the week that saw `most conversion and retention`
- There are `453 users whose preferred langauge does not match the ad in which the language was served`. This led to a `significant dip in conversion rate`, which is to be resolved with data correction
